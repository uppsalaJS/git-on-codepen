**Q:**
*Hi! Is there a way to fetch data from github in codepen? Like having a git repo as the src for a pen? Or maybe chosen parts of a repo? It would be awesome if I could keep them in sync. Right now I make some changes to a pen based on a repo and in the end I have bits and pieces of data everywhere /Karl*

**A:**
*We have that logged internally as an idea that we really want to make happen. I know exactly what you mean and would love to make it happen. What could be helpful is more information about how exactly you would use it, how you would expect it to work, and potentially even an example repo we could try and wire up to make it work. /Chris Coyier*
